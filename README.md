I am not advocating that you attack YouTube (maybe because you're a LeafyIsHere fan; I know he's an angry turd but he's right about pokimane...)

But if you wanted to attack amazon you can try to hijack a control pointer by looking at code that passes both a return address and does something else that screws up the return address to the compiler AT THE SAME TIME then you can figure out how zero days work in assembly and machine code

Else you can take a set of leaks (Experian, any number I get in email every day) spoof it through banks etc, then shop at YouTube

To reverse a hash file (password file stored on servers) you simply get a list of primes through the i=set(initial_primes); for threat j in size(i) / count(j): find_primes(j); repeat until done to sys.maxsize or something; then reverse RSA or something easily

The find prime algorithm is to divide candidate int ( figure out the ALU internals of your processor or GPU or tensorcore to determine the exact algorithm to use ) by already found set of primes then if modulo of the divisions is never zero, you found another prime

Using floating point does not help in the operations because the ALUs do not let you approximate better than int even if you change FP64 default to support larger numbers; check out circuit design and proof for exactly why this is true
